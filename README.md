# Alchemist Builder Concept

Application to create combinations of two elements in user-friendly way

## Description

Briefly: here you can create some *elements* based on other ones (A + B = C),
interface should provide reliable way to see *missed (unpaired)* elements, have controls to add/edit/combine elements easily. 

> Nice UX > Nice UI

1. Each element is a combination of two others  
   **Exception:** BASE and FINAL elements

2. Basic element structure at least contains:
   - Name
   - Type (GENERIC / BASE / FINAL)
   - Parents ("how to create this element")
   - Connections ("where this element is used")

3. Autogenerated (AI) element structure could also contain:
   - Image
   - Internal parameters for better context merging

4. Storing data in JSON hash-table

## Design

| Mock data |
| --------- |
| **Elements:** Water, Earth, Fire, Mud, Steam, Lava, Air |

1. All elements
2. Used elements (at least 1 connection)
3. Missed elements (without pair and excluding BASE elements)
4. Create new combination here:  
   `[input] + [input] = [input] [Save]`
